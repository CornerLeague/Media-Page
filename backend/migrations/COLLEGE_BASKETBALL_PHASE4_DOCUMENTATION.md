CREATE INDEX idx_players_team_id ON players(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_players_academic_year_id ON players(academic_year_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_players_position ON players(primary_position);
CREATE INDEX idx_players_eligibility ON players(eligibility_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_players_team_jersey ON players(team_id, jersey_number);

-- Statistics Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_team_statistics_team_year ON team_statistics(team_id, academic_year_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_statistics_type ON team_statistics(statistic_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_statistics_player_year ON player_statistics(player_id, academic_year_id);

-- Rankings Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_rankings_team_system ON rankings(team_id, ranking_system);
CREATE INDEX idx_rankings_system_date ON rankings(ranking_system, ranking_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_rankings_rank ON rankings(rank);

-- Advanced Metrics Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_advanced_metrics_net_efficiency ON advanced_metrics(net_efficiency);
CREATE INDEX idx_advanced_metrics_team_year ON advanced_metrics(team_id, academic_year_id);

-- Season Records Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_season_records_team_type ON season_records(team_id, record_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_season_records_wins ON season_records(wins);
```

## Usage Examples

### **Player Analytics Queries**

#### **Top Scorers by Position**
```sql
SELECT
    p.full_name,
    p.primary_position,
    ps.points / ps.games_played as ppg,
    ps.field_goal_percentage,
    ps.three_point_percentage
FROM players p
JOIN player_statistics ps ON p.id = ps.player_id
WHERE ps.statistic_type = 'season_average'
    AND p.primary_position = 'point_guard'
    AND p.is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY ppg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **Transfer Portal Analysis**
```sql
SELECT
    p.full_name,
    p.previous_college,
    c.name as current_school,
    ps.points / ps.games_played as ppg
FROM players p
JOIN colleges c ON p.team_id IN (
    SELECT ct.id FROM college_teams ct WHERE ct.college_id = c.id
)
JOIN player_statistics ps ON p.id = ps.player_id
WHERE p.is_transfer = TRUE
    AND ps.statistic_type = 'season_average'
ORDER BY ppg DESC;
```

### **Team Performance Analysis**

#### **Efficiency Rankings**
```sql
SELECT
    ct.name as team_name,
    c.name as college_name,
    am.offensive_efficiency,
    am.defensive_efficiency,
    am.net_efficiency,
    r.rank as ap_rank
FROM college_teams ct
JOIN colleges c ON ct.college_id = c.id
JOIN advanced_metrics am ON ct.id = am.team_id
LEFT JOIN rankings r ON ct.id = r.team_id
    AND r.ranking_system = 'ap_poll'
    AND r.is_current = TRUE
WHERE am.is_current = TRUE
ORDER BY am.net_efficiency DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

#### **Record Quality Analysis**
```sql
SELECT
    ct.name as team_name,
    sr_overall.wins as overall_wins,
    sr_overall.losses as overall_losses,
    sr_q1.wins as quad1_wins,
    sr_q1.losses as quad1_losses,
    (CAST(sr_q1.wins AS FLOAT) / (sr_q1.wins + sr_q1.losses)) as quad1_pct
FROM college_teams ct
JOIN season_records sr_overall ON ct.id = sr_overall.team_id
    AND sr_overall.record_type = 'overall'
JOIN season_records sr_q1 ON ct.id = sr_q1.team_id
    AND sr_q1.record_type = 'quad_1'
WHERE sr_overall.is_current = TRUE
    AND sr_q1.is_current = TRUE
ORDER BY quad1_pct DESC;
```

### **Ranking System Comparisons**

#### **Multi-System Rankings**
```sql
SELECT
    ct.name as team_name,
    MAX(CASE WHEN r.ranking_system = 'ap_poll' THEN r.rank END) as ap_rank,
    MAX(CASE WHEN r.ranking_system = 'coaches_poll' THEN r.rank END) as coaches_rank,
    MAX(CASE WHEN r.ranking_system = 'net_ranking' THEN r.rank END) as net_rank,
    MAX(CASE WHEN r.ranking_system = 'kenpom' THEN r.rank END) as kenpom_rank
FROM college_teams ct
JOIN rankings r ON ct.id = r.team_id
WHERE r.is_current = TRUE
    AND r.is_ranked = TRUE
GROUP BY ct.id, ct.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT r.ranking_system) >= 3
ORDER BY ap_rank;
```
