Phase 7 Critical Fix: Immediate repair of existing teams
=======================================================

This is a focused fix to address the critical issue where:
- Basketball teams exist but have no league memberships
- Football teams exist but have no league memberships
- College Football teams exist but have no league memberships

This will quickly fix the onboarding issue by ensuring all existing teams
have proper league associations.
