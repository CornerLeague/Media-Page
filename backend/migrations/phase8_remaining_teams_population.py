Phase 8: Remaining Teams Population (Baseball, Hockey, College Basketball)
=========================================================================

This migration completes the team population by adding:
1. Baseball teams (30 teams - American League & National League)
2. Hockey teams (32 teams - 4 divisions)
3. College Basketball teams (149+ teams - 9 conferences)

All the critical infrastructure fixes were completed in Phase 7.
This focuses on populating the remaining missing teams.
