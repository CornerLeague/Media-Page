## Technical Details

### Schema Changes

#### **Teams Table - BEFORE Phase 4**
```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sport_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    league_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ⚠️ DEPRECATED COLUMN
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    market TEXT NOT NULL,
    slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
    FOREIGN KEY (sport_id) REFERENCES sports (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (league_id) REFERENCES leagues (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- ⚠️ DEPRECATED
    UNIQUE (league_id, slug)  -- ⚠️ DEPRECATED CONSTRAINT
);
```

#### **Teams Table - AFTER Phase 4**
```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sport_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- league_id REMOVED ✅
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    market TEXT NOT NULL,
    slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
    FOREIGN KEY (sport_id) REFERENCES sports (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    -- Unique constraint removed ✅
);
```

### New Performance Indexes

The following indexes were added to optimize query performance:

#### **Teams Table Indexes**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_sport_id ON teams(sport_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_slug ON teams(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_country_code ON teams(country_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_founding_year ON teams(founding_year);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_is_active ON teams(is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_sport_country ON teams(sport_id, country_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_name_search ON teams(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_market_search ON teams(market);
```

#### **Team-League Memberships Indexes**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_team_active ON team_league_memberships(team_id, is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_league_active ON team_league_memberships(league_id, is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_composite ON team_league_memberships(is_active, season_start_year, season_end_year);
```

#### **Leagues Table Indexes**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_leagues_sport_type_level ON leagues(sport_id, competition_type, league_level);
CREATE INDEX idx_leagues_country_active ON leagues(country_code, is_active);
```

### API Logic Updates

#### **Primary League Determination**

**OLD Logic** (deprecated):
```python
# Used deprecated league_id column
primary_league = next(
    (league for league in leagues_info if league.id == team.league_id),
    leagues_info[0] if leagues_info else None
)
```

**NEW Logic** (Phase 4):
```python
def _determine_primary_league(self, leagues_info: List[LeagueInfo]) -> Optional[LeagueInfo]:
    """
    Intelligent primary league determination using heuristics:
    1. Domestic leagues (league_level 1, competition_type 'league')
    2. Earliest membership (longest history)
    3. Highest league level (lower number = higher tier)
    4. Alphabetical fallback
    """
    if len(leagues_info) == 1:
        leagues_info[0].is_primary = True
        return leagues_info[0]

    # Sort by priority criteria
    def league_priority(league: LeagueInfo) -> tuple:
        is_domestic = (league.competition_type == 'league' and league.league_level == 1)
        return (
            not is_domestic,  # Domestic leagues first
            league.season_start_year,  # Earlier seasons first
            league.league_level,  # Lower level = higher tier
            league.name  # Alphabetical fallback
        )

    sorted_leagues = sorted(leagues_info, key=league_priority)
    primary = sorted_leagues[0]

    # Mark the primary league
    for league in leagues_info:
        league.is_primary = (league.id == primary.id)

    return primary
```

## Migration Safety Measures

### **Rollback Protection**
1. **Multiple backup points** created at different stages
2. **Emergency rollback script** (`phase4_rollback.py`) available
3. **Atomic transactions** ensuring all-or-nothing changes
4. **Foreign key constraint management** to prevent cascading deletes

### **Data Validation**
1. **Pre-migration validation** of all data relationships
2. **Post-migration validation** confirming data preservation
3. **Continuous monitoring** during migration process
4. **Rollback triggers** for any data integrity issues
