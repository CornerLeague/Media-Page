## Key Features

### 1. Play-by-Play Tracking

```python
# Example: Creating a play-by-play record
play = PlayByPlay(
    game_id=game.id,
    offense_team_id=offense_team.id,
    defense_team_id=defense_team.id,
    quarter=2,
    down=3,
    distance=7,
    yard_line=35,
    play_type=FootballPlayType.PASS,
    play_result=PlayResult.GAIN,
    yards_gained=12,
    is_explosive_play=True,
    expected_points_added=Decimal('0.85')
)
```

### 2. Drive Analytics

```python
# Example: Analyzing drive efficiency
drive = DriveData(
    game_id=game.id,
    offense_team_id=team.id,
    total_plays=8,
    total_yards=75,
    drive_result=DriveResult.TOUCHDOWN,
    points_scored=7,
    yards_per_play=Decimal('9.38'),
    success_rate=Decimal('0.75')
)

# Access calculated properties
print(f"Drive efficiency: {drive.drive_efficiency}")
print(f"Third down rate: {drive.third_down_percentage}")
```

### 3. Advanced Metrics

```python
# Example: EPA calculation for a team
epa_metric = FootballAdvancedMetrics(
    team_id=team.id,
    season_id=season.id,
    metric_type=AdvancedMetricType.EPA,
    metric_category=StatisticCategory.EFFICIENCY,
    metric_value=Decimal('0.15'),
    percentile_rank=Decimal('75.3'),
    sample_size=450
)

# Performance tier calculation
print(f"Performance tier: {epa_metric.performance_tier}")  # "Above Average"
```

### 4. Position-Specific Statistics

```python
# Example: Quarterback statistics
qb_stats = FootballPlayerStatistics(
    player_id=qb.id,
    season_id=season.id,
    position_group=FootballPositionGroup.QUARTERBACK,
    passing_attempts=320,
    passing_completions=210,
    passing_yards=2850,
    passing_touchdowns=22,
    qbr=Decimal('89.5')
)

# Access calculated properties
print(f"Completion %: {qb_stats.passing_completion_percentage}")
print(f"YPA: {qb_stats.passing_yards_per_attempt}")
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Red Zone Analysis

```python
# Find red zone drives and calculate efficiency
red_zone_drives = session.query(DriveData).filter(
    DriveData.is_red_zone_drive == True,
    DriveData.offense_team_id == team.id
).all()

scoring_drives = [d for d in red_zone_drives if d.points_scored > 0]
red_zone_efficiency = len(scoring_drives) / len(red_zone_drives)
```

### 2. Third Down Performance

```python
# Analyze third down conversion rates by distance
third_down_plays = session.query(PlayByPlay).filter(
    PlayByPlay.down == 3,
    PlayByPlay.offense_team_id == team.id
).all()

short_yardage = [p for p in third_down_plays if p.distance <= 3]
conversions = [p for p in short_yardage if p.yards_gained >= p.distance]
conversion_rate = len(conversions) / len(short_yardage)
```

### 3. Player Performance Analysis

```python
# Compare quarterback efficiency across teams
qb_stats = session.query(FootballPlayerStatistics).filter(
    FootballPlayerStatistics.position_group == FootballPositionGroup.QUARTERBACK,
    FootballPlayerStatistics.passing_attempts >= 100
).all()

# Sort by QBR
top_qbs = sorted(qb_stats, key=lambda x: x.qbr or 0, reverse=True)
```

### 4. Advanced Metrics Dashboard

```python
# Get team's advanced metrics for dashboard
team_metrics = session.query(FootballAdvancedMetrics).filter(
    FootballAdvancedMetrics.team_id == team.id,
    FootballAdvancedMetrics.season_id == current_season.id
).all()

metrics_by_type = {}
for metric in team_metrics:
    metrics_by_type[metric.metric_type] = {
        'value': metric.metric_value,
        'percentile': metric.percentile_rank,
        'tier': metric.performance_tier
    }
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes

Comprehensive indexing strategy for analytics queries:

```sql
-- Play-by-play analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_football_pbp_situational ON football_play_by_play (down, distance, field_position);
CREATE INDEX idx_football_pbp_analytics ON football_play_by_play (is_successful_play, is_explosive_play, is_stuff);

-- Drive analytics
CREATE INDEX idx_football_drives_result ON football_drive_data (drive_result);
CREATE INDEX idx_football_drives_situational ON football_drive_data (is_red_zone_drive, is_two_minute_drive);

-- Statistics queries
CREATE INDEX idx_football_player_stats_position ON football_player_statistics (position_group);
CREATE INDEX idx_football_player_stats_passing ON football_player_statistics (passing_yards, passing_touchdowns);
```

### Query Optimization

```python
# Efficient team comparison query
team_comparison = session.query(
    FootballTeam.id,
    FootballTeam.display_name,
    func.avg(FootballAdvancedMetrics.metric_value).label('avg_epa')
).join(FootballAdvancedMetrics).filter(
    FootballAdvancedMetrics.metric_type == AdvancedMetricType.EPA
).group_by(FootballTeam.id, FootballTeam.display_name).all()
```

## Data Integrity

### Validation Rules

1. **Play Sequencing**: Plays must be sequential within drives
2. **Field Position**: Yard line must be between 0-100
3. **Down Consistency**: Down must be 1-4, distance > 0
4. **Score Validation**: Points scored must match play results
5. **Time Constraints**: Game clock and quarter progression

### Referential Integrity

- All plays linked to valid drives and games
- All statistics linked to valid players/teams/seasons
- Proper cascade rules for data cleanup
- Foreign key constraints enforced

## Migration and Deployment
