## 🚨 Issues Identified & Resolutions

### Critical Issues: NONE ✅

No blocking issues were identified during verification.

### Minor Observations:

1. **Firebase Configuration Warning** (Non-blocking)
   - **Issue**: Firebase config validation warning on startup
   - **Impact**: Testing only - does not affect API functionality
   - **Resolution**: Expected behavior in test environment

2. **League Data Structure** (Enhancement Opportunity)
   - **Observation**: Traditional leagues appear to use multi-league membership system
   - **Impact**: None - team selection works correctly
   - **Note**: Design choice supports complex league relationships

## 📋 Frontend Implementation Guidelines

### Recommended API Usage Patterns

1. **Onboarding Flow Sequence**:
   ```
   GET /onboarding/sports
   → User selects sports
   → GET /onboarding/teams?sport_ids=uuid1,uuid2
   → User selects teams
   → POST /api/user/team-preferences (with auth)
   ```

2. **Team Search Implementation**:
   ```
   GET /api/teams/search?query=user_input&page=1&page_size=20
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use debounced search queries (300ms delay)
   - Implement client-side pagination
   - Cache sport listings (changes infrequently)

### Error Handling

All endpoints return standardized error format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
    "status": 400,
    "details": { ... }
  }
}
```
