## Agent Handoff Protocol

### feature-planner → nextjs-frontend-dev Handoff

**Required Deliverables**:
1. Complete task breakdown with dependencies
2. TypeScript interface contracts
3. Quality gate definitions
4. Performance requirements
5. Integration specifications

**Handoff Validation**:
- [ ] All contracts reviewed and approved
- [ ] Implementation approach validated
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed
- [ ] Timeline agreed upon
- [ ] Communication channels established

### nextjs-frontend-dev → validation-testing Handoff

**Required Deliverables**:
1. Implemented component with full functionality
2. Unit test foundation established
3. Documentation for test scenarios
4. Performance baseline measurements
5. Integration point specifications

**Handoff Validation**:
- [ ] Component functionality demonstrated
- [ ] Test strategy reviewed and approved
- [ ] Quality standards confirmed
- [ ] Coverage requirements understood
- [ ] Timeline for testing agreed upon

### validation-testing → feature-planner Handoff

**Required Deliverables**:
1. Complete test suite with coverage reports
2. Quality validation results
3. Performance benchmark data
4. Accessibility audit results
5. Production readiness assessment

**Final Handoff Validation**:
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Deployment procedures validated
- [ ] Monitoring requirements confirmed
- [ ] Team training completed (if required)

## Quality Gate Enforcement Matrix

| Quality Gate | Threshold | Owner | Validation Method | Remediation Process |
|--------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥90% | validation-testing | Automated coverage reports | Add missing tests |
| Performance | <200ms navigation | nextjs-frontend-dev | Automated benchmarks | Optimize implementation |
| Accessibility | 100% axe-core score | validation-testing | Automated a11y testing | Fix violations |
| Security | No vulnerabilities | validation-testing | Automated security scan | Address findings |
| Documentation | 100% API coverage | feature-planner | Manual review | Complete missing docs |

## Coordination Failure Prevention

**Communication Protocol**:
- [ ] Daily stand-up updates during active work
- [ ] Immediate escalation for blocking issues
- [ ] Shared documentation workspace established
- [ ] Regular checkpoint meetings scheduled
- [ ] Clear ownership matrix maintained

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
1. **Technical Conflicts**: Escalate to feature-planner for architecture decision
2. **Timeline Conflicts**: Reassess scope and priorities with stakeholders
3. **Quality Conflicts**: Apply CLAUDE.md standards as final arbiter
4. **Resource Conflicts**: Escalate to project management for resolution

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Zero coordination delays >24 hours
- [ ] All handoffs completed with full documentation
- [ ] No quality gate failures requiring rework
- [ ] Production deployment successful on first attempt
- [ ] Post-deployment monitoring shows expected performance

## Emergency Procedures

**Critical Issue Response**:
1. **Production Break**: Immediate rollback using documented procedures
2. **Security Vulnerability**: Emergency patch deployment process
3. **Performance Regression**: Immediate investigation and hotfix
4. **Accessibility Violation**: Rapid remediation and re-deployment

**Escalation Matrix**:
- **Level 1**: Agent-to-agent direct communication
- **Level 2**: feature-planner coordination intervention
- **Level 3**: Project stakeholder involvement
- **Level 4**: Emergency response team activation
