# Dashboard Integration Test Plan

## Section 1.2 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented dashboard integration for personalized content as specified in onboarding-completion-plan.md section 1.2.

### âœ… Implemented Components

1. **useAuth() Hook** (`/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
   - Provides user preferences from onboarding data
   - Combines Firebase auth with backend user profile data
   - Falls back to local onboarding storage when API unavailable
   - Returns sports, teams, and content frequency preferences

2. **usePersonalizedFeed() Hook** (`/src/hooks/usePersonalizedFeed.ts`)
   - Fetches and aggregates personalized content
   - Filters content by sport preferences, team affinity, and news types
   - Applies content frequency settings (minimal/standard/comprehensive)
   - Provides featured team selection based on highest affinity score

3. **TeamSection Component** (`/src/components/TeamSection.tsx`)
   - Displays all selected teams from onboarding
   - Shows team cards with recent results and game status
   - Provides team navigation and management actions
   - Includes affinity scores and league information

4. **ContentFeed Component** (`/src/components/ContentFeed.tsx`)
   - Personalized content feed with filtering and sorting
   - Sports and frequency-based content filtering
   - News type preferences applied
   - Multiple view modes (all content, teams only, sports only, trending)

5. **Enhanced Dashboard** (Updated `DashboardPage` in `/src/App.tsx`)
   - Integrated all new personalization components
   - Shows selected teams with TeamSection
   - Displays personalized content feed
   - Uses featured team for existing sections (AI Summary, Best Seats, Fan Experiences)

### âœ… Success Criteria Met

1. **Dashboard reflects user's sport selections**
   - ContentFeed filters content by selected sports
   - Sports preferences drive content prioritization
   - Featured team selected from user's highest affinity team

2. **Team content is filtered and displayed**
   - TeamSection shows all user's selected teams
   - Team-specific news aggregated and prioritized
   - Team affinity scores influence content ranking

3. **Content frequency preferences are applied**
   - Minimal: 10 items, Standard: 25 items, Comprehensive: 50 items
   - Frequency setting displayed in ContentFeed header
   - Applied across all content queries

4. **Smooth transition from onboarding to dashboard**
   - useAuth hook seamlessly loads user preferences
   - Local storage fallback ensures no data loss
   - Dashboard personalizes immediately upon completion

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

**Data Flow:**
1. User completes onboarding â†’ preferences saved locally and to API
2. Dashboard loads â†’ useAuth retrieves preferences from API or localStorage
3. usePersonalizedFeed fetches content based on preferences
4. Components render personalized content with filtering and prioritization

**Fallback Strategy:**
- API unavailable â†’ Use local onboarding storage
- No preferences â†’ Use sensible defaults
- Graceful degradation for missing team/sport data

**Performance Optimizations:**
- React Query caching (5-minute stale time)
- Lazy loading of team dashboards
- Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms
- Skeleton loading states

### ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Steps

1. **Complete Onboarding Flow:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   â†’ Navigate to onboarding
   â†’ Select sports (e.g., basketball, football)
   â†’ Select teams (e.g., Lakers, Cowboys)
   â†’ Set preferences (e.g., standard frequency, injuries enabled)
   â†’ Complete onboarding
   ```

2. **Verify Dashboard Personalization:**
   - âœ… TeamSection displays selected teams
   - âœ… ContentFeed shows sports/team-specific content
   - âœ… Content frequency badge shows correct setting
   - âœ… News types filtered by enabled preferences
   - âœ… Featured team (highest affinity) used in AI Summary

3. **Test Content Filtering:**
   - âœ… Filter by "Your Teams" shows only team-related content
   - âœ… Filter by "Your Sports" shows only sport-specific content
   - âœ… News type filter respects onboarding preferences
   - âœ… Content frequency setting limits displayed items

4. **Verify Smooth Transition:**
   - âœ… No loading delays between onboarding completion and dashboard
   - âœ… User preferences immediately visible in dashboard
   - âœ… No manual configuration required post-onboarding

### ðŸ“Š Integration Points

**Backend API Integration:**
- `GET /me/home` - User's home data with most liked team
- `GET /teams/{id}/dashboard` - Team-specific dashboard data
- `GET /sports/feed` - Personalized sports content
- `GET /auth/onboarding-status` - User onboarding completion status

**Local Storage Fallback:**
- `corner-league-onboarding-status` - Complete onboarding state
- Automatic sync when API becomes available
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact

1. **Personalization Achievement:**
   - Users see content specific to their selected sports and teams
   - Content volume controlled by user's frequency preference
   - News types filtered by user's interests

2. **User Experience Enhancement:**
   - Immediate value after onboarding completion
   - No additional setup required
   - Intuitive content discovery and filtering

3. **Technical Robustness:**
   - Works with or without backend API
   - Graceful error handling and fallbacks
   - Optimized performance with caching
