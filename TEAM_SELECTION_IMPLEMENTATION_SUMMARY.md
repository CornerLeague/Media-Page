├── useTeamSelection.ts          # Custom hook for state management
├── api-client.ts               # Enhanced API client with team search
└── TeamSelectionStep.tsx      # Updated onboarding step integration

// Key Features
├── Debounced Search            # 300ms debounced API calls
├── Multi-select UI             # Team chips with remove functionality
├── Error Boundaries            # Comprehensive error handling
├── Loading States              # Skeleton screens and spinners
├── Accessibility               # ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
└── TypeScript Safety           # Strict typing from backend contract
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Team Search Implementation
interface TeamSearchParams {
  query?: string;        // Search team name or market
  sport_id?: string;     // UUID filter by sport
  page_size?: number;    // Pagination support
  is_active?: boolean;   // Filter active teams only
}

// Backend Endpoint: GET /api/teams/search
// ✅ Successfully integrated with real backend API
// ✅ Handles 265+ teams across 6 major sports
// ✅ Supports fuzzy search and sport filtering
```

### User Experience Flow
```
1. User completes Step 2 (Sports Selection)
   ↓
2. Navigates to Step 3 (Team Selection)
   ↓
3. Sees searchable dropdown with selected sports
   ↓
4. Types to search or browses teams by sport
   ↓
5. Selects favorite teams (up to 10)
   ↓
6. Sees selected teams as removable chips
   ↓
7. Continues to Step 4 with team preferences saved
```

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### 1. **Search Functionality**
- **Debounced Input**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Sport Filtering**: Automatically filters by user's selected sports
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Backend supports flexible team name matching
- **Real-time Results**: Instant feedback with loading indicators

### 2. **Multi-select Interface**
- **Team Chips**: Selected teams displayed as removable badges
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected teams highlighted in dropdown
- **Maximum Limits**: Configurable selection limits (default: 10)
- **State Persistence**: Selections saved locally and to backend

### 3. **Error Handling & Resilience**
- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation with offline indicators
- **Network Issues**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Validation**: Prevents navigation without team selection
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery guidance

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
- **Query Caching**: React Query with 15-minute stale time
- **Request Cancellation**: Automatic cleanup of pending requests
- **Virtualization Ready**: Architecture supports large team lists
- **Bundle Optimization**: Minimal impact on application size
