# Team Selection Search & Dropdown Implementation Plan

**Date:** September 22, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** High - Fixing broken user experience

## Executive Summary

Investigation revealed that the onboarding team selection step is missing critical search and filtering functionality that is expected by the test suite but not implemented in the actual UI component. Users currently see a static list of teams without search capabilities, making team discovery difficult.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Issues
1. **Missing Search Functionality** - No search input for finding teams
2. **No Filtering Options** - Cannot filter by league or sport
3. **Poor UX for Large Lists** - Static cards make it hard to find specific teams
4. **Test-Implementation Mismatch** - Tests expect features that don't exist in UI

### Impact
- Poor user experience during onboarding
- Difficulty finding specific teams
- Test suite failing due to missing UI elements
- Potential user dropoff during onboarding

## Implementation Requirements

### Must-Have Features
1. **Search Input** - Text search for team names and markets
2. **League Filter Dropdown** - Filter teams by league (NFL, NBA, etc.)
3. **Clear Search Button** - Reset search and filters
4. **Maximum Selection Limit** - Prevent selection of more than 10 teams
5. **Search State Persistence** - Maintain selections when filtering

### Technical Requirements
1. **Real-time Search** - Filter teams as user types
2. **Case-insensitive Search** - Match regardless of case
3. **Debounced Input** - Avoid excessive re-renders
4. **Keyboard Navigation** - Support accessibility standards
5. **Mobile Responsive** - Work on all device sizes
