Phase 2 Critical Database Analysis
==================================

This script performs comprehensive analysis of the sports database to identify:
1. Orphaned teams (teams without league memberships)
2. Broken foreign key relationships
3. Referential integrity issues
4. Data quality problems affecting onboarding
