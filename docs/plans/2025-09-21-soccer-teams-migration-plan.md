# Soccer Teams Database Migration Implementation Plan

**Date:** September 21, 2025
**Planner:** Tech Lead
**Context:** Adding comprehensive soccer teams and leagues with many-to-many relationships

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the critical need to add 144 soccer teams across 6 leagues while solving the fundamental limitation in our current schema where teams can only belong to one league. Many soccer teams participate in multiple competitions (e.g., Arsenal in both Premier League and UEFA Champions League).

**Key Challenge:** Current schema only supports one-to-many (league → teams) but soccer requires many-to-many (teams ↔ leagues).

## Current State Analysis

### Database Schema (Current)
- **PostgreSQL database** with existing sports, leagues, teams tables
- **Teams table** has `league_id` foreign key constraint (one league per team)
- **Soccer sport** exists with 2 leagues: Premier League, MLS
- **NO teams** currently exist for soccer leagues
- **Working migrations** system with Alembic

### Data to Import
1. **Premier League** (21 teams) - already exists in DB
2. **UEFA Champions League** (36 teams) - needs to be added
3. **Major League Soccer** (29 teams) - already exists in DB
4. **La Liga** (20 teams) - needs to be added
5. **Bundesliga** (18 teams) - needs to be added
6. **Serie A** (20 teams) - needs to be added

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Schema Limitation**: Teams can only belong to one league
- **Data Duplication**: Many teams appear in multiple leagues
- **International Complexity**: Mix of domestic leagues and international competitions
- **Performance Impact**: Current queries optimized for one-to-many relationships

## 1. Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK - Schema Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Removing `league_id` from teams table breaks existing code
- **Impact**: API endpoints, ORM relationships, frontend queries fail
- **Mitigation**: Phased migration with backward compatibility layer

### MEDIUM RISK - Data Integrity
- **Risk**: Team name/market conflicts across leagues
- **Impact**: Duplicate or inconsistent team data
- **Mitigation**: Normalization rules and validation constraints

### MEDIUM RISK - Performance Degradation
- **Risk**: Junction table queries slower than direct foreign keys
- **Impact**: Dashboard and API response times increase
- **Mitigation**: Strategic indexing and query optimization

### LOW RISK - Migration Complexity
- **Risk**: Multi-step migration could fail partially
- **Impact**: Database in inconsistent state
- **Mitigation**: Atomic transactions and rollback procedures

## 2. Phase-by-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Schema Enhancement (NON-BREAKING)
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Goal:** Add new tables without disrupting existing functionality

#### Tasks:
1. **Create new junction table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE team_league_memberships (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     league_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES leagues(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     membership_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'regular',
     is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
     season_start INTEGER,
     season_end INTEGER,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     UNIQUE(team_id, league_id)
   );
   ```

2. **Add enhanced team metadata**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN official_name VARCHAR(200);
   ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN short_name VARCHAR(50);
   ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN country_code VARCHAR(3);
   ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN founded_year INTEGER;
   ```

3. **Add league metadata**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN country_code VARCHAR(3);
   ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN league_level VARCHAR(20);
   ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN competition_type VARCHAR(30);
   ```

4. **Create optimized indexes**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_team ON team_league_memberships(team_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_league ON team_league_memberships(league_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_team_league_memberships_primary ON team_league_memberships(team_id) WHERE is_primary = true;
   CREATE INDEX idx_teams_country ON teams(country_code);
   CREATE INDEX idx_leagues_country ON leagues(country_code);
   ```

**Quality Gate:** All existing functionality works unchanged

### Phase 2: Data Migration and Cleanup
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Goal:** Migrate existing data to new structure and add soccer teams

#### Tasks:
1. **Migrate existing team-league relationships**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO team_league_memberships (team_id, league_id, is_primary, membership_type)
   SELECT id, league_id, true, 'regular' FROM teams WHERE league_id IS NOT NULL;
   ```

2. **Add missing soccer leagues**
   - UEFA Champions League
   - La Liga
   - Bundesliga
   - Serie A

3. **Import soccer teams with normalization**
   - Parse `soccer_teams.md` data
   - Normalize team names (official_name vs display name)
   - Set country codes based on league
   - Handle multi-league memberships

4. **Populate team-league memberships**
   - Mark domestic league as `is_primary = true`
   - Add international competition memberships

**Quality Gate:** All soccer teams properly normalized with correct league memberships

### Phase 3: API and Backend Updates
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Goal:** Update backend code to use new schema

#### Tasks:
1. **Update SQLAlchemy models**
   - Add `TeamLeagueMembership` model
   - Update relationships in `Team` and `League` models
   - Add backward compatibility properties

2. **Update API endpoints**
   - Modify team queries to use junction table
   - Add league filtering capabilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility for existing clients

3. **Add new query patterns**
   ```python
   # Teams in specific league
   teams_in_league = session.query(Team).join(TeamLeagueMembership).filter(
       TeamLeagueMembership.league_id == league_id
   ).all()

   # Leagues for specific team
   team_leagues = session.query(League).join(TeamLeagueMembership).filter(
       TeamLeagueMembership.team_id == team_id
   ).all()
   ```

**Quality Gate:** All API endpoints return expected data with acceptable performance

### Phase 4: Schema Finalization
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Goal:** Remove deprecated column and finalize schema

#### Tasks:
1. **Verify all code uses new relationships**
2. **Remove `league_id` column from teams table**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN league_id;
   ```
3. **Update constraints and validations**
4. **Run final data verification**

**Quality Gate:** Clean schema with no deprecated columns, all tests pass

## 3. Data Migration Strategy

### Team Normalization Rules
1. **Official Name**: Use full official club name from soccer_teams.md
2. **Display Name**: Use commonly known name (e.g., "Arsenal" not "Arsenal Football Club")
3. **Market**: Use city/region (e.g., "London" for Arsenal)
4. **Country Codes**: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (ENG, USA, ESP, GER, ITA)

### Multi-League Membership Logic
```
For each team appearing in multiple leagues:
1. Identify primary domestic league (is_primary = true)
2. Add secondary international competition memberships
3. Set appropriate membership_type ('regular', 'qualifying', 'guest')
```

### Conflict Resolution
- **Name Conflicts**: Append league context if needed
- **Market Conflicts**: Use most specific geographic identifier
- **Duplicate Detection**: Match on official_name + country_code

## 4. Quality Assurance Plan

### Automated Tests
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Model relationship integrity
   - Query performance benchmarks
   - Data validation rules

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoint functionality
   - Cross-league team queries
   - Migration rollback procedures

3. **Data Validation Tests**
   ```sql
   -- Verify no orphaned memberships
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_league_memberships tlm
   LEFT JOIN teams t ON tlm.team_id = t.id
   WHERE t.id IS NULL;

   -- Verify every team has a primary league
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM teams t
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
     SELECT 1 FROM team_league_memberships tlm
     WHERE tlm.team_id = t.id AND tlm.is_primary = true
   );
   ```

### Manual Verification
1. **Sample Team Queries**: Verify Arsenal appears in both Premier League and Champions League
2. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark query times before/after migration
3. **API Response Validation**: Ensure frontend data contracts maintained

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 144 soccer teams imported successfully
- [ ] Multi-league relationships work correctly
- [ ] API response times within 10% of baseline
- [ ] Zero data integrity violations
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Frontend displays team data correctly

## 5. Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (Phase 1-2)
If issues detected early:
```sql
-- Drop new tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS team_league_memberships;

-- Remove added columns
ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS official_name;
ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS short_name;
ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS country_code;
ALTER TABLE teams DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS founded_year;

ALTER TABLE leagues DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS country_code;
ALTER TABLE leagues DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS league_level;
ALTER TABLE leagues DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS competition_type;
```

### Partial Rollback (Phase 3-4)
If API issues detected:
1. Revert backend code to use `league_id` column
2. Re-add `league_id` column with data from memberships table
3. Keep enhancement tables for future use

### Data Recovery
- **Alembic Migration Rollback**: `alembic downgrade -1`
- **Database Backup**: Restore from pre-migration snapshot
- **Staged Rollout**: Test rollback procedure on staging environment

## 6. Performance Impact Analysis

### Expected Changes
| Query Type | Current Performance | New Performance | Change |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Teams in League | O(1) index lookup | O(1) index lookup | No change |
| Team's Leagues | N/A | O(1) index lookup | New capability |
| Cross-league queries | Not possible | O(log n) join | New capability |

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Indexed Joins**: Strategic indexes on junction table
2. **Query Patterns**: Prefer `EXISTS` over `IN` for large sets
3. **Caching Layer**: Consider Redis cache for frequent team-league lookups
4. **Database Statistics**: Update table statistics after migration

### Monitoring
- Track API response times before/during/after migration
- Monitor database query execution plans
- Set up alerts for performance degradation > 15%

## 7. API Impact Analysis

### Affected Endpoints
1. **GET /teams/{team_id}**: Add `leagues` array to response
2. **GET /leagues/{league_id}/teams**: Update query logic
3. **GET /teams**: Add league filtering capabilities
4. **POST /me/preferences**: Support multi-league team selections

### New Capabilities Enabled
1. **Team League History**: Track when teams joined/left leagues
2. **Cross-League Analytics**: Compare team performance across competitions
3. **Flexible Team Following**: Users can follow teams across multiple leagues
4. **International Competition Support**: UEFA, Copa America, World Cup, etc.
