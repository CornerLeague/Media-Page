**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Assign Phase 1 tasks to development team
2. Begin authentication flow integration (Task 1.1)
3. Set up testing and staging environments
4. Schedule daily standups for progress tracking

**Expected Timeline to Production:**
- **Minimum Viable**: 5-7 days (Phases 1-2 critical fixes)
- **Production Quality**: 2-3 weeks (Phases 1-2 complete)
